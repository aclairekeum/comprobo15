# Warmup Project Writeup
---
### Team Members: 
1. For each behavior, what strategy did you use to implement the behavior?

2. For the finite state controller, what were the states?  

3. What did the robot do in each state? 

4. How did you combine and how did you detect when to transition between behaviors?

5. How did you structure your code?
What if any challenges did you face along the way?

6. What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?

7. Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects?
